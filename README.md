## Technical stack

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) / [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/)
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) / [Ts-mockito](https://github.com/NagRock/ts-mockito)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) / [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Prerequisites

You must have **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** installed, or **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** and **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)** to run PostgreSQL using the provided `docker-compose.yml`.

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **16.x** and `node-gyp` installed globally (`npm install -g node-gyp`).

## Quickstart

First, install dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

Then start the servers, database and other services:

```
make start
```

In a separate terminal, run database migrations:

```
make database-migrate
```

The server and client will be started:

- API documentation available on <http://localhost:3000/api>
- Client available on <http://localhost:3001/>

To serve the built server and client locally, run:

```
make build
make start-dist
```

To run tests, use:

```
make test
```

For E2E tests, you will need to install additional dependencies first:

```
make install-client-e2e
```

Run E2E tests using:

```
make test-client-e2e
```

To run automatic code formatting, run:

```
make format
```

To run linters and code checks, use:

```
make linter
```

## Security

The client must send the user `apiToken` in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources : `Authorization: Bearer <apiToken>`

At the installation of the project a default user was created :

```json
{
  "email": "john@doe.com",
  "password": "john"
}
```

To retrieve the `apiToken`, make a post request on `/login` with a user email and password.

## Helpers

This following command will display all available helpers :

```bash
make help
```

## Tests

Run the unit test suite with this following command:

```bash
make test
```
